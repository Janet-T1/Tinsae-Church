                    We are a group of passionate youth, driven by a deep love for Jesus,
                    with our only intention being to honor Him and keep Him at the center of our lives.
                    We are committed to serving Him with all our might as we dedicate our youth
                    to His glory. Our primary focus is to grow together in the pursuit of knowing Christ
                    more intimately. We have been profoundly impacted by the love of Jesus, and as a result
                    have chosen to devote our lives to seeking Him as we strive to know Him on a personal and deeply
                    intimate level. In a generation that has forsaken Jesus and the statutes of God, we
                    stand firm on the gospel, refusing to bow down to the Baals of our time. Instead, we choose to be
                    ambassadors and representatives of Christ. We trust in His promises, and therefore, we will
                    renew our strength, mount up with wings as eagles, run without growing weary, and walk without fainting,
                    as we wait upon the Lord.
